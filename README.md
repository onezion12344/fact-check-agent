## Why "Double-Check"?

AI verification is not a two-horse race. The research landscape spans **6+ distinct approaches**, each with different tradeoffs. Double-Check occupies a specific niche that none of the others fill.

### The Landscape

| Route | Approach | What It Checks | Examples | This Project |
|:------|:---------|:---------------|:---------|:-------------|
| **Training** | Train model when to (not) use tools | Reduces unnecessary tool calls | SMART (ACL 2025), Metis/HDPO, Tool-Overuse Illusion | ❌ Doesn't verify — just reduces frequency |
| **Policy** | External gate: is this tool allowed? | Permission level, safety constraints | Veto, AgentSpec, Edictum, AGT, Probity | ❌ Blocks bad calls but doesn't verify correctness |
| **Planning** | Pre-execution: optimal tool chain | Cost-aware tool sequencing | Feasible is Not Enough (ACL 2026), ToolTree (ICLR 2026), AutoTool (AAAI 2026) | ❌ Plans before execution, doesn't audit after |
| **Selection-time** | Self-verify: is this the right tool? | Distinguish close candidates | ToolVerifier (Meta 2024) | ❌ Verifies during selection, not after |
| **Runtime guard** | Deduplicate: is this call redundant? | Same tool+args repeated | Tool Spam patterns, MLflow ToolCallEfficiency, Session dedup | ❌ Catches repetition, not mis-selection |
| **Bias analysis** | Why does model pick this tool? | Fairness across providers | BiasBusters (ICLR 2026) | ❌ Analyzes, doesn't correct |
| **🔵 Double-Check** | **Post-hoc: was that the right tool?** | **Efficiency / redundancy / privilege / scope** | **This project — post-hoc tool selection verification** | **✅ The only approach that verifies after execution** |

**The key insight:** all 6 routes above check *something*, but none check whether the tool the agent *already called* was the optimal choice for the task. That's the gap Double-Check fills — a **post-hoc tool selection correctness verifier**, running as a 5-phase pipeline (SIFT → CoVe+FIRE → FABLE → Truth Sandwich).

### Where Double-Check Sits

The project has **two layers**:

| Layer | What | Portability |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| **SKILL.md** (methodology) | 5-phase pipeline doc | **Any LLM** — load as system prompt, works on Claude Code, ChatGPT, OpenClaw, Cursor, any API |
| **Hermes Plugin** (auto hooks) | Always-on pre/post verification | **Hermes Agent** (tested) — other platforms theoretically possible but not yet tested |

The methodology is fully portable. The automatic enforcement via lifecycle hooks is currently Hermes-native but could be adapted.

### The Bounded Rationality Problem

AI agents have bounded rationality — they won't verify enough on their own.  
Rather than waiting for better models, we build a system that double-checks every claim, regardless of which model generates it.

---

## Why

LLMs hallucinate. Even at 5% error rate, AI agents produce millions of incorrect facts daily. Existing solutions fall into two camps:

| | Journalism Standards | LLM Verification |
|:-|:--------------------|:-----------------|
| **Rigor** | ✅ IFCN 5 Principles, multi-source | ❌ Single-pass classification |
| **Speed** | ❌ Human-speed | ✅ LLM-speed |
| **Our approach** | Keep the rigor | Add the speed |

## Benchmark Results

40 questions × 3 judges (DeepSeek V4 Flash / V4 Pro / verified sources).

| Metric | Raw V4 Flash | + Double-Check |
|:-------|:------------:|:--------------:|
| Overall | 62.5% | **97.5%** |
| Prices | 50% → | 100% |
| Specs | 80% → | 100% |
| Stats | 50% → | 100% |
| Schedules | 70% → | 100% |
| Errors caught | — | **15/15 (100%)** |
| False positives | — | 0 |

## Pipeline

```
User Query
  ↓
[Phase 0] Dedup Gate — emergency skip + content check
  ↓
[Phase 0.5] Pre-answer — extract claims, time-sensitive = force search
  ↓
LLM Response
  ↓
[Phase 1] SIFT — source attribution (✅ source / ⚠️ guessed / ❌ contradiction)
  ↓
[Phase 2] CoVe + FIRE — independent cross-verification, ≥2 sources
  ↓
[Phase 3] FABLE — impact grading (🔴 Critical / 🟡 Experience / 🟢 Cosmetic)
  ↓
[Phase 4] Truth Sandwich — structured correction delivery
```

Key design rules:
- Each phase does ONE thing. Never search AND judge in the same round.
- Time-sensitive items (prices, hours, schedules) force external search.
- Emergency bypass for time-sensitive user scenarios.
- Multi-agent parallel execution when ≥15 claims need verification.

## Architecture

The Double-Check system has **two layers** — portable methodology + Hermes-native enforcement.

### Layer 1: SKILL.md (Portable)

The methodology document at `skill/SKILL.md` is pure prompt. Works as system context on any LLM-based agent:

| Platform | How to load |
|:---------|:------------|
| **Claude Code** | Add to project, reference in `CLAUDE.md` |
| **OpenClaw / Cursor** | Import as custom skill or system prompt |
| **ChatGPT / Claude.ai** | Paste Phase 0.5 steps as custom instructions |
| **Any API** | Prepend to system message |

The pipeline (SIFT → CoVe+FIRE → FABLE → Truth Sandwich) is framework-agnostic — no code changes needed to use it as guidance.

### Layer 2: Hermes Plugin (Automatic)

The Python plugin at `plugin/` uses Hermes-specific lifecycle hooks:

| Hook | What it does | API |
|:-----|:-------------|:----|
| `pre_llm_call` | Detect factual questions → inject context | Hermes lifecycle hook |
| `transform_llm_output` | Check dense responses for factual claims | Hermes output hook |
| `ctx.llm.complete()` | Classify question type (fact/theory/tool-use) | Hermes context API |
| `delegate_task` | Spawn sub-agents for deep verification | Hermes sub-agent system |

**Key design: Plugin is orchestrator, not worker.** It only detects and delegates — the actual verification runs in a sub-agent. This keeps the plugin at ~100 lines and lets the sub-agent use all available tools (search, browser, terminal).

### Running on Other Agents

To get automatic verification on a non-Hermes agent:

| Effort | Method | Result |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| **Low** | Load SKILL.md as system prompt prefix | Manual pre-check, no code |
| **Medium** | Wrap agent calls in a Python script | Auto pre-answer + post-answer |
| **High** | Implement lifecycle hooks on your platform | Full auto enforcement |

Minimal Python wrapper example:

```python
import openai

def safe_answer(user_query):
    with open("skill/SKILL.md") as f:
        skill = f.read()
    system = skill + "\n\nFollow Phase 0.5 before answering."
    return openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": system},
                  {"role": "user", "content": user_query}]
    )
```

## Case Studies

### Camino de Santiago Planning
- Round 1: 23 ⚠️ (guessed addresses/prices), 55 ✅ (source confirmed)
- Round 2: 4 wrong addresses + 6 wrong prices/times found
- Round 3: 1 🔴 (Correos Sunday closure → break Madrid plans), 6 🟡, 3 🟢
- **9% → 0% error rate**

### AI Foldable Phone Research
- 44 claims verified across 6 rounds
- Price errors: Nillkin ¥200→¥500, Poetic $23→$59
- Feature hallucination: BOW HB199 touchpad (doesn't exist)
- **9% → 3% → 0% error rate**

## Trade-offs: Journalism vs Academia

Researched against actual papers (June 2026).

| Dimension | 📰 Journalism | 🧠 LLM Academic | Our Hybrid |
|:----------|:------------:|:--------------:|:--:|
| **Core mechanism** | Lateral reading > close reading | Independent answering > self-Q&A | Both |
| **Automation** | ❌ Manual | ✅ Agent-native | Agent-native |
| **Adversarial adapt.** | ❌ Public frameworks targeted | ✅ Doesn't rely on single method | ✅ 2 sources minimum |
| **Motivated reasoning** | ⚠️ Aware, can't solve | ❌ Not studied | ⚠️ Ceiling — unsolved |
| **Empirical base** | Classroom/community | Benchmark datasets | Both + production data |

## Pitfalls

### 🐙 Don't Fabricate Numbers
"Reasonable" guesses are almost always wrong. Octopus protein: guessed 15g, actual 29.8g (USDA).

### ⚠️ Dual-Source Contamination
Tour brochure ≠ user's actual booking. Round 1 must tag *intended* source (user vs document), not just *literal* source.

### 💰 1688 Wholesale ≠ Retail
Same item: 1688 ¥15-30 / Taobao ¥50-80 / Amazon $23-60. Always check ≥3 platforms.

### 📊 Don't Mix GPU Benchmarks
Community scores vary by thermals, firmware, ambient temp. Use GSMArena review page 4 or Notebookcheck.

### ⏰ Yesterday's Source May Be Wrong
Time-sensitive items always need current verification. Correos Santiago: opened 7 days in 2024, but 2025 sources still say "closed Sundays."
